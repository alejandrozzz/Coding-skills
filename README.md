# Coding-skills

This is the project that briefly shows my coding skills.

PHP Section 1:
Code Analysis
This section focuses on your ability to analyze,
debug, and repair existing php code. The code
samples given may emit php error messages,
contain logic errors, or fail to run at all.
For each question, please provide as much detail as possible:
1. Identify mistakes, describe what problems they cause, and propose a fix for them.
2. Recommendations for general improvements and an explanation of why the change(s) would improve the code.
3. Predict the output of the corrected code.

PHP Section 2:
In this section, you will be required to write actual code according to the instructions given. Your top priority is
creating code that meets the functional and technical requirements of each question. However, the code will be
evaluated using the following criteria:
1. Accuracy – How well did the code meet the given instructions?
2. Clarity – How easy is it to understand the intent of the code?
3. Syntax – Would the code execute without errors, warnings, and notices?
4. Conciseness – Simple code is good code; is the solution unnecessarily complex?
5. Extensibility – How easily can the code be modified to meet future needs?
6. Best Practices – Does the code follow common coding best practices?
You may use all tools provided to you by the PHP language. You may also add any notes you feel necessary to
further explain your coding decisions.
